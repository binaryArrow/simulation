## USAGE
Creating cars: declare speed and distance to front car and press **ADD** Button **Caution** The first Car created is the last Car starting!
If you want to create for example three cars with a distance of 10 meters to one another, you have to create the first and the second car with 10 meters distance and the last car
with 0 distance(0 distance marks the first car in the row).
In the table of cars you can break a car individually and the other ones react to it automatically. 
With the **RESET** button you can reset the simulation to the starting stage(streets still remain, to reset street, refresh the browser).
For more information about the simulation, open devtools with F12 and go to console.
